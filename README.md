### Installation
Note: First time installations may take awhile to load since ~1GB of cryptographic data must be downloaded first.

##### Windows and MacOS
The simplest way to get started on Windows or MacOS is to [download and run the latest installer](https://github.com/zencashofficial/eleos/releases).

##### Linux
Note: Eleos requires that the compiled wallets are named zcashd-linux or zcld-linux and are saved into the eleos directory.
Get the dependencies

The default Node.JS version in the default Debian repositories is incompatible with Eleos, you'll need to download the latest version:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
vim nodesource_setup.sh        # Read the file before running it to make sure it's not malicious
chmod +x nodesource_setup.sh
./nodesource_setup.sh
apt-get install nodejs
```

You'll also need various npn packages:
```
npm install electron tcp-port-used tar-fs request-progress ht-auth express-ws node-pty
```

Get the source
```
git clone https://github.com/zencashio/eleos.git eleos
```

Copy the Zclassic/Zcash wallet daemon into the elos directory (name the binary zcld-linux or zcashd-linux)
```
cp ~/Builds/zclassic/src/zcashd ~/Builds/elos/zcld-linux
```
or
```
cp ~/Builds/zcash/src/zcashd ~/Builds/elos/zcashd-linux
```
Start eleos
```
cd ~/Builds/eleos && npm start
```

For mac, the files are located in:
```
/Applications/eleos.app/Contents/Resources/app
```
